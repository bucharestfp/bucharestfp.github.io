        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The session will go through design paradigms of modern JVM languages
        and of old and reliable functional ones, which enable the building of
        concurrent and resilient architectures. It will be tailored for IT
        architects, with practical examples of advantages and differences in
        choosing between the functional languages presented.</p>
