        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Composition is a fundamental aspect of Functional Programming. We will
        explore how to compose things using monoids, applicatives, and monads;
        we will look at the differences between these abstractions, but also try
        to find the common patterns.</p>
        <p>We will only assume basic knowledge of the Haskell syntax.</p>
