        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Ovidiu is a software developer at Eloquentix, where he currently works
        with Scala on an application that involves data analysis and reporting.
        Besides functional programming, he has a long term interest in the things
        that fall under the umbrella term "Data Science" (machine learning,
        statistics, math, distributed computing).</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>This presentation will first provide an overview on some basic machine
        learning concepts like the bias-variance tradeoff, the curse of dimensionality,
        overfitting and cross-validation. We will then take a deeper dive into
        the bias-variance tradeoff and take a look at some machine learning
        algorithms from both ends of the spectrum, like linear regression and
        ensemble methods.</p>
        <p>The presentation will be interactive, meaning that many of the concepts
        above will be exemplified with code. This is a good opportunity to introduce
        R, a language that is getting more and more popular with people who are
        working with data. Because R is not a general purpose programming language,
        but designed to do data analysis and visualizations, we will not focus on
        its syntax, but on the concepts themselves, which are language agnostic.
        R will serve as a tool to illustrate the ideas from the presentation and
        we will see that many aspects of it are heavily influenced by functional
        programming.</p>
