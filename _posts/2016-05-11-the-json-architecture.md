        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Constantin has over 7 years experience in web agencies and start-ups.
        He's a functional programming enthusiast and advocates for simpler, more
        maintainable and creative programming. His passion projects are productivity
        tools for developers that aim to make their life easier.</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>

        <p>Functional programming (FP) is simply amazing and turns popular
        programming paradigms upside down, making most practices obsolete. But
        how do you actually write with FP a full-fledged production-grade
        working application with a complex UI for your clients? How do you
        manage state? How do you make it maintainable by developers and not by
        Computer Scientists? How do you design the architecture?</p>

        <p><strong>The JSON Architecture</strong> is a culmination of using FP
        in practice and provides a concrete answer to using stateless, functional
        and point-free programming in production.</p>

        <p>Through the melding of state, streams and side-effects, a counter-
        intuitive way of building applications emerges: a centralized state
        model that pulls updates from pure function streams and dispatches
        changes to side-effect listeners. This goes against the API-first design
        and teaches a State-first mental model that greatly reduces the
        cognitive load on the developer.</p>

        <p>Complexity no longer grows with the application but plateaus very early
        in the development cycle making <strong>The JSON Architecture</strong> a
        good candidate for long term, multi-team development.</p>

        <p>It is not a technology in itself, but a collection of open source
        projects and concepts that can be implemented in any programming
        language or system.</p>

        <p>This presentation gives an overview, explains the design decisions and
        goes through the numerous opportunities and benefits developers gain
        from using it in practice.</p>
