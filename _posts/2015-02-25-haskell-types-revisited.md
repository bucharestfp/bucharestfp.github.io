        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Haskell is a purely functional, statically typed programming language
        developed to serve mainly as a tool for programming languages research.
        Some of its most distinctive features are represented by its strict type
        checker and automatic type inference engine, which together provide a
        form of compile-time lightweight formal verification.</p>
        <p>This talk will give an example-driven overview of these features: we
        will go through the basics of constructing Haskell types and then use
        this knowledge to show how we can define programs that are correct or
        almost correct by design. Last but not least, we will explore the type
        system's limitations, i.e., design cases that are impossible or impractical
        to verify using it.</p>
