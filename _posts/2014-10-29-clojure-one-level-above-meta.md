        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Mihnea is working as a software engineer at Hootsuite and he is currently
        pursuing a master's in Artificial Intelligence. He's currently interested in
        open source, web technologies and programming languages. The aspect he likes
        most about experimenting with Clojure is that it allows a practical and
        accessible way of interacting with abstract concepts.</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>We will first take a quick look at Clojure — its syntax, fundamental
        concepts and pros. Then, we will take a dive into core.async, a library
        exposing a way to do asynchronous programming in Clojure. Finally, we
        will raise the level of abstraction and talk about Clojure's next big
        idea — transducers.</p>
