        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Software lifetime can be measured in years, in same cases in tens of
        years. The effort starts with the development of the first version, but
        later, most of the time is spent on maintenance, debugging, enhancements,
        refactoring, testing and reading code.</p>
        <p>Engineers are always looking for the best tools for the job. Choosing
        the right stack of languages and tools has a big impact on the architecture,
        usability, performance, operations, quality and costs of the software you
        develop and also affects your joy of programming.</p>
        <p>Following this engineering perspective, in this presentation we'll
        explore Erlang and OTP as a tool that can help you build better software.
        Things like "concurrent programming", "message passing", "fault tolerance",
        "distributed systems", "hot code swapping", "high availability", "scalability",
        "pattern matching", and  of course "functional programming" are going to
        introduce you in the Erlang world and hopefully will convince you to use
        Erlang in your projects.</p>
