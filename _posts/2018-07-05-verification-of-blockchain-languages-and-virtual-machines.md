        <h2 class="speaker">Grigore Roșu</h2>
        <p>Grigore Roșu is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at the
        University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where he leads the
        Formal Systems Laboratory (FSL), and the founder and president of
        Runtime Verification, Inc (RV).</p>
        <p>His research interests encompass both theoretical foundations and system
        development in the areas of formal methods, software engineering and
        programming languages.</p>
        <p>Before joining UIUC in 2002, he was a research scientist at NASA. He
        obtained his Ph.D. at the University of California at San Diego in 2000.
        He was offered the CAREER award by the NSF, the Dean's award for
        excellence in research by the College of Engineering at UIUC in 2014,
        and the outstanding junior award by the Computer Science Department at
        UIUC in 2005. He won the ASE IEEE/ACM most influential paper award in
        2016 (for an ASE 2001 paper that helped shape the runtime verification
        field), the ACM SIGSOFT distinguished paper awards at ASE 2008, ASE
        2016, and OOPSLA 2016, and the best software science paper award at
        ETAPS 2002.</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Many of the recent cryptocurrency bugs and exploits are due to flaws or
        weaknesses of the underlying blockchain programming languages or virtual
        machines.</p>
        <p>The usual post-mortem approach to formal language semantics and
        verification, where the language is firstly implemented and used in
        production for many years before a need for formal semantics and
        verification tools naturally arises, simply does not work anymore.</p>
        <p>New blockchain languages or virtual machines are proposed at an alarming
        rate, followed by new versions of them every few weeks, together with
        programs (or smart contracts) in these languages that are responsible
        for financial transactions of potentially significant value.</p>
        <p>Formal analysis and verification tools are therefore needed immediately
        for such languages and virtual machines.</p>
        <p>We present recent academic and commercial results in developing
        blockchain languages and virtual machines that come directly equipped
        with formal analysis and verification tools.</p>
        <p>The main idea is to generate all these automatically, correct-by-
        construction from a formal specification.</p>
        <p>We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach by applying it
        to two blockchains, Ethereum and Cardano.</p>
        <p>We also discuss the mathematical foundations underlying our formal
        analysis and verification tools, specifically matching logic and the K
        framework.</p>
