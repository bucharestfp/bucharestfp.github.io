        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Ricardo has been a professional software developer for over 20 years,
        and a hacker and tinkerer for even longer. He’s currently working as a
        CTO-for-hire at Numergent, creating large sensor-driven interactive
        installations, writing data visualizations and keeping himself entertained.</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>We’ll dissect Clojure as a language from a pragmatist’s perspective.
        We’ll discuss how is it different, where do you start, and evaluate an
        approach to building a web application fully in Clojure (both front end
        and back end). I’ll defend the heretical suggestion that having no
        automagic is good. More importantly, we’ll aim to answer the key question
        any tool should answer: what’s in it for you?</p>
