        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Adriana Bălan is a lecturer at the Department of Mathematical Methods and
        Models, University Politehnica of Bucharest, where she works since 1997. She has
        obtained her PhD in Mathematics in 2008 at the University of Bucharest, with a
        thesis on Quantum Groups Theory.</p>
        <p>Currently, her main research interests focus on Category Theory and its
        applications in Logic and Computer Science, particularly on coalgebraic logic.</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Category Theory, albeit has origins in algebra and topology, has found use in
        recent decades for Computer Science and Logic applications. For example,
        Category Theory is an increasingly popular setting for describing the semantics
        of functional programming languages. Also, the categorical paradigm has
        influenced the language design, and given rise to several of the language
        elements, like functors, monads and arrows.</p>
        <p>This talk will introduce the language of category theory, limited to the most
        elementary and important notions and results, with an eye towards its
        applications to and correspondences with Haskell.</p>
