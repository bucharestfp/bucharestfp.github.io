        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Fable is an F# to JavaScript compiler powered by Babel, designed to
        produce readable and standard code compatible with ES2015 standards,
        like modules, classes or iterables. Streamlines the development with
        advanced language features like static typing with type inference,
        exhaustive pattern matching, immutability by default, structural
        equality, units of measure, tree shaking and more.</p>
        <p>This talk will give a brief overview of F# syntax, some glimpse of
        interaction with JavaScript libraries and will end with a demo of
        Elmish in action.</p>
        <p>We assume no prior knowledge of F#, although some familiarity with
        basic FP concepts is desired.</p>
