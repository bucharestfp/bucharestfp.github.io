        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>PureScript (http://www.purescript.org/) is a strongly-typed
        functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. This talk
        will give a brief overview of the PureScript syntax and a few key
        features, demo the language tooling and showcase Halogen, one of its
        numerous UI libraries.</p>
        <p>The talk assumes no prior knowledge of PureScript, although some
        familiarity with basic FP concepts (sum and product types, very basic
        Haskell syntax) is assumed.</p>
