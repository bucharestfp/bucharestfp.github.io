        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Applicatives and monads are all nice and useful, but sometimes seeing a
        novel way of employing them might deepen our understanding of the
        subject. This is what this talk aims for by showing a practical and
        somewhat unusual application of the Applicative abstraction.</p>
        <p>We will look at the task of optimizing network calls — in this
        particular case, OpenTSDB queries — and show how using an Applicative
        interface enables us to design an API that's oblivious to the
        optimization processes, while still keeping the code purely functional.</p>
