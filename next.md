        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Ionuț is a software developer at Eloquentix, where he works on backend
        services using Scala. His current interests revolve around functional
        programming techniques, programming languages and compilers.</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Regardless of whether you love or hate statically typed languages, you
        probably have some respect for those which at least allow the programmer
        to write as few type annotations as possible. It's one of the reasons
        people are initially attracted to Scala, Haskell or an ML dialect, such
        as Standard ML, OCaml or F#. But how does that work? How is it possible
        to ensure type safety while writing few or, indeed, no type annotations
        at all?</p>
        <p>This presentation aims to answer that question. We'll reconstruct the
        classic Damas-Hindley-Milner algorithm from the ground up for a small
        subset of ML. Scala will be used as an implementation language.</p>
        <p>In addition to showing how type inference works, we'll also see its
        limits — what language features make type inference hard or even impossible.</p>
