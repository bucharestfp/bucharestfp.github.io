        <h2 class="speaker">Ionuț G. Stan</h2>
        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Ionuț is a software developer at Eloquentix, where he works on backend
        services using Scala. His current interests revolve around functional
        programming techniques, programming languages and compilers.</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>

        <p>Transforming text to some in-memory data structure — parsing, as it's
        usually called — is perceived as a form of black magic. It looks like a
        complicated thing to do and parsing an actual programming language even
        more so. It is actually held in such a high regard that some people seem
        to mistake parsing for the task of writing a compiler or interpreter in
        its entirety, which is certainly not the case.</p>

        <p>While not always a trivial task, parsing is probably easier than you
        think and I'll try to prove it during this presentation. We'll see how a
        stream of characters is transformed into a stream of tokens, which are
        then fed to the parser proper that will finally derive an in-memory tree
        data structure. I will be using Scala as the implementation language and
        a subset of Standard ML as the language to parse.</p>
