        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p><a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> gives developers complete
        access to <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>'s ecosystem by running
        on the Erlang VM — a platform used by companies like Heroku, WhatsApp,
        Klarna, Basho and many more to build distributed, fault-tolerant applications.</p>
        <p>Elixir is the power of its tooling, the expressiveness of its
        metaprogrammability and the expansive feature set of its standard library.
        All this while maintaining complete compatibility with — and heavily
        leveraging — OTP, a batteries included distribution of Erlang.</p>
